# MERN Practice Repository

This repository is created for my personal practice of the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).

🔧 **Note:**  
Currently, the files in this repo are mainly focused on the **MEN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js). React will be added gradually as I expand the frontend side.

## 🧱 Stack Overview

- **MongoDB** – NoSQL Database  
- **Express.js** – Web framework for Node.js  
- **Node.js** – Backend JavaScript runtime  
- **(React.js)** – Frontend library *(to be included later)*
